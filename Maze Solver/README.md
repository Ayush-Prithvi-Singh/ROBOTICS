Developed an autonomous maze-solving robot using the Arduino microcontroller, employing the Left-Hand Rule algorithm for pathfinding. The robot utilizes an array of sensors, such as infrared or ultrasonic, to detect walls and obstacles in its environment. By following the Left-Hand Rule, the robot continuously keeps its left side in contact with the maze walls, ensuring it navigates through the maze in a systematic manner.

The system was programmed to process sensor inputs in real-time, allowing the bot to make decisions regarding movement, turning, and stopping. The robot was equipped with motor drivers for movement control and the necessary feedback mechanisms to handle various maze configurations. The project demonstrates practical application of algorithms in robotics, emphasizing autonomous navigation and decision-making.
