Engineered a comprehensive 3D model of a prosthetic arm using SolidWorks, incorporating detailed design considerations for functionality and ergonomics. Conducted structural integrity and stress analysis using ANSYS to ensure durability and reliability under operational loads. Fabricated the prototype using advanced 3D printing technology with nylon as the material, chosen for its high strength-to-weight ratio and flexibility. Integrated an Arduino microcontroller with an electromyography (EMG) sensor for precise control and real-time responsiveness to muscle signals, enabling natural and intuitive movement.
